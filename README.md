## Features

- **Dynamic LED Effect**: ColorGreet assigns a special "Welcome" role to new members, creating a dynamic LED effect by changing the role's color multiple times before removing it.

- **Preventing Misuse**: The bot keeps track of member IDs in a file (`join.txt`) to prevent users from abusing the welcome feature by joining multiple times.

- **Customizable Configuration**: Server-specific settings, including the guild ID, welcome channel ID, and rules channel ID, can be configured in the `config.json` file.

## Setup

1. **Token Configuration**: Replace `'Your token goes here'` in the last line of the code with your Discord bot token.

2. **Configuration File (`config.json`)**:
   - Customize server-specific settings such as the guild ID, welcome channel ID, and rules channel ID in the `config.json` file.

3. **Role Creation**:
   - If the "Welcome" role does not exist, ColorGreet will attempt to create it. Ensure the bot has the necessary permissions to create roles.

4. **Dependencies Installation**:
   - Install the required dependencies using the following command:
     ```bash
     pip install discord.py
     ```

5. **Run the Bot**:
   - Execute the script to run ColorGreet. Example:
     ```bash
     python colorgreet_bot.py
     ```

## Configuration File (`config.json`)

The `config.json` file contains server-specific configuration details. Customize this file according to your server's needs.

```json
{
  "guild": 123456789012345678,        // Your server's ID
  "welcome_channel": 123456789012345, // ID of the welcome channel
  "rules_channel": 123456789012345    // ID of the rules channel
